# mini-blockchain
A mini implementation based on blockchain concept. Hope the implementation can help you understand more about Golang. of course, will know more clear about blockchain 

# Installation
- install spew, which allow us to to view `struct` and `slice` cleanly formatted in console 

 `$go get -u github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew`
 
- We need to access the blockchain from browser. so let's install *Gorilla/mux*, which is a popular package for writing web handlers.

`$go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`

- In a real product, there are so many configuration there. So we may have a environment reader for easy implementation.

`$go get -u github.com/joho/godotenv`
